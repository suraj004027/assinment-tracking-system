views.py — the "brain" of the assignments app.

A Django VIEW is just a Python function that receives a request
(what the user asked for) and returns a response (a web page).

For this page we write a plain FUNCTION-BASED VIEW — the simplest
kind of view — because we want every concept to be easy to see.

    Show the "add assignment" form AND the list of assignments on ONE page.

    HTTP has two common "methods" (kinds of requests):

      * POST -> "here is form data, please save it"
                (used when you submit a <form method="post">)

    So this one function handles BOTH jobs:
      1. GET  -> build an empty form and show the page.
      2. POST -> fill the form with what the student typed, check it,
                 save it to the database, then send the browser back
